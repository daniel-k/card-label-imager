# Card label imager

This tool helps you generate printable PDF files that you can print on label
paper with the goal to create labels for RFID cards in the common credit card
format (ISO 7810 ID-1).

## How it works

1. You upload an image
2. The shape of a credit card is shown with your image in the background
3. You can move the position of your image and scale it so it fits the card as you want
4. you click "save" and it gets added to a DIN A4 pdf file
5. optionally, you can add more card labels like the one before until the page is full
